I used Power Bi as it's one of the most popular and powerful data visualization software.

before building the dashboard, data needed a lot of transformation processes to be able to visualize and extract important information to make enhancements for the company depending on the data

the stakeholders want to know some information from the data they have like:

what is the preferable place for employees to work, from home or the office
what are the most days that employees prefer to work from home and the days they prefer to work on-site in
why do people have sick leave and what could be the reason
 

The transformation processes I did on data were:

1- Make all date columns in one column

2- renaming columns

3- changing some columns type

4- Make a parameter to refer to the month we want to choose

 

Now, the data is ready for the dashboard

The most important measures we need to build the dashboard are the percentage of Sick Leave, Presence, and Work from Home count.

So I build them then the report shows those numbers in addition to their trend charts, with some useful tables
